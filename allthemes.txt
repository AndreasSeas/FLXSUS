I learned more about the lifestyle and general thought processes of neurosurgeons. I was already familiar with several aspects of the career itself, but it was very cool to learn more about personal lives and personalities of the neurosurgeons that presented, Dr. Barthelemy being my favorite! I learned from him that one can pursue other interests in medicine and science besides staying laser-focused on neurosurgery and still be a successful, passionate doctor. 

The breakout rooms could have been better organized by assigning topics to each volunteer/mentor, and then students can join the appropriate room of topic they wish to learn more about/talk more about. Probably half the breakout session was introductions of everybody, which wasn't very productive. 

Otherwise, the symposium was planned very thoroughly. I attended last year and recommended it to all of my colleagues! Managed to get 2 friends to attend with me this year, and they enjoyed the experience and they, too, had positive takeways from the symposium that applied to their future careers in medicine. Very well done.

===============================

Every path is different and it takes a want to diligence to persevere. You have to go hard in the paint and work hard for it. As you play hard you have to work hard too. Staying opening minded during residency creates a well rounded surgeons that can help more ppl because they have see a lot more. Surgery require time and planning as well as searching up some procedures to visualize tactics. Patients are more likely to have more faith in you if you take your time to tell them about yourself. Always get to know your patients as that will help you be able to understand better than just observing from a far. I want to be a part of the black neurosurgeon community as well as learning from all kinds of people that either look like me or are willing to teach me how to not only go to medical school but stay in medical school. I hope that you are willing to give all your information as well as allowing us to be able to shadow some of you in the later future. 

===============================

My greatest takeaway was realizing that failure happens even to the people we look up to and admire. The way you pick yourself back up and be the writer of your own story is what leads you to becoming whatever you want to be.

I learned that minorities are often picked against for positions even in the medical field and not given the same backing at times. I also learned that the need for people who can understand and help guide those who come from a minority population are critical in our success and way forward in medicine.

Part of me wishes we spent more time in the breakout rooms, but I understand why the time allotted for that section was the same as the other parts of the conference. Otherwise, I just want to thank the committee and all the panelists for such an impactful experience and I hope I can join again. Perhaps someday in the future I will be in a place in my career where I can help out or be a part of the symposium. Thank you! 

===============================

I learned that neurosurgery isn't just another field in medicine, however, a gifted form of art. The time and effort it takes to cultivate a neurosurgeon are truly amazing. Of course, it takes an insane level of commitment and dedication, however, the view from the top is breathtaking. FLNSUS has reassured me of my dream of becoming a neurosurgeon since I was 8 years old. I now understand the aspects needed not only to perform well during my undergraduate career but also in my medical school and residency career too. FLNSUS is an amazing, one-of-a-kind opportunity I believe should be here to stay. The cultivating of neurosurgeons from different backgrounds, career paths, etc. has sparked the next generation of underrepresented minority neurosurgeons. And for that, I say thank you. Thank you for establishing this symposium. The countless efforts put into this program will be beneficial to future neurosurgeons for years to come.

===============================

My greatest takeaway from the symposium is that everyone's journey in neurosurgery is different, and that is entirely ok. No matter how long it takes, if its really what I want to pursue, I'll do it. 

Something new I learned is that failure is acceptable. It is ok to fail. Neurosurgery is hard. There will be sleepless nights and endless days. What matters is that one bounces back higher than ever after experiencing a failure. Use the challenges to one's advantage. 

I want to thank the planning committee for putting this amazing symposium together. It changed my life and impacted me on a personal level. I learned about different areas in Neurosurgery that I have now developed an interest in. (One being peripheral nerve regeneration from Dr. Levi's presentation). 
Thank you!!!!

===============================

I learned more about the research you can do as a neurosurgeon scientist and was very inspired by the journey's of the doctors who spoke. I enjoyed hearing from peers in the breakout rooms and the symposium was very informative and showed that there is support in such a competitive and cut throat career. I am going to work harder now after hearing the encouragement from everyone who spoke and not give up. I liked the highlighting of the point that everyone's journey is unique and that we should not compare ourselves to other people because everyone's journey is different. Also, the point that if we know this is something we want to do that we shouldn't be discouraged by people telling us we can't. Thank you so much this was a very informative and resourceful opportunity.

===============================

I really enjoyed hearing from all the speakers. Unfortunately, I got kicked out of the last 30 minutes of the webinar because of a storm and power outage, but I've never actually had the chance to take a deep delve into neurosurgery as a medical career. Probably my favorite part of the symposium was getting to hear from people in neurosurgery who looked like me--women of color. They helped build my confidence and reassure me that neuroscience and neurosurgery specifically was a possibility for someone like me, and they were all very open to mentoring and helping future doctors like me succeed both in medical school and beyond. The advice they gave was also incredibly insightful, and I would love to attend more symposiums similar to this one in the future.

===============================

I really enjoyed the diversity in people of color and minorities in the field, before coming to the symposium I couldn‚Äôt picture the idea since I never met a Latino neurosurgeon before. I was truly inspired by Dr. Rodriguez and more specifically  Dr. Qui√±√≥nez story since I am an undocumented student myself.  Something new I learned was ‚ÄúPrecision medicine‚Äù I thought that getting a MD/PhD would limit opportunities to do research in academic setting and split time practicing in clinic but this approach really caught my attention and from this symposium I feel like I am inspired to research more to see how can I integrate this in my future career.
I also enjoyed the initiative of Diversity in clinical research and I would like to hear more about it 

===============================

My greatest takeway is that as a minority I can become a neurosurgeon as long as I put my heart to it,nothing is stopping me. Also, hearing from those that spoke in today's meeting,has changed my view of neurosurgery as a career. It is wonderful to work as a neurosurgeon as long as you love what you do. Also,neurosurgery is a wide field.There are other beautiful interests apart from going to an operating room. This symposium has increased my knowledge about neurosurgery and it was a way for me to meet, hear from and connect with neurosurgeons of my race since I have never met any in my life. It was very informative, interesting and interactive. Thanks to those that spoke today. I would want to be part of the next symposium.

===============================

My greatest takeaway after listening to all the keynote speakers is to never give up, try choosing different ways but don‚Äôt leave your journey towards becoming a neurosurgeon just because you face obstacles. When hearing from highly accomplished doctors and surgeons my outlook towards preparing for my very first steps towards med school and fulfilling my dream to help others and the community so that they can also get access to equal care. The panel sessions from speakers strengthened more and has motivated me to keep going and working towards doing better. I really liked how they all came from different educational backgrounds and how they all were able to achieve the feat of becoming tremendous doctors.  

===============================

Becoming a neurosurgeon is doable, it is not impossible and far out of reach as I had previously thought. The entire symposium was phenomenal, I do not think I have ever been to a better informational event as a current pre-med student. I did not know that shadowing in the OR was possible so to get a walk-through from a current neurosurgery resident was very eye-opening. I learned about the different types of neurosurgeons and the plethora of paths that can be taken to achieve this great career goal! The only thing I would incorporate for next time is an embedded time for a lunch break, just because I did not really get to eat as I did not want to miss any of the amazing discussions!

===============================

I learned so much about being forward-thinking, planning ahead and dealing with failures to keep my mind on the goals I want to achieve. I was incredibly impressed and excited to attend the presentations, all of them were amazing and I am overall very happy and positive after seeing so many amazing mentors and hearing their stories and how they never gave up. As a woman who entered medical school with high hopes and has been berated and undermined many times, I can‚Äôt thank you enough for giving me this new energy! I‚Äôm very grateful for today and hope we‚Äôll keep in touch and that I‚Äôll be able to attend the next symposium, as well as other events organized by this committee!

===============================

The biggest thing I took away form the symposium is that it is possible for me to go into neurosurgery. I have never seen so many neurosurgeons that look like me or had similar back stories. The women in neurosurgery was my favorite part because it felt so personable. Having a family was one of the biggest things that I worried about going into this career. The biggest thing I learned was what steps I can take that others have taken in order to reach my goals. Maybe the symposium can be split over 2 days because all the content was so valuable but it might be more digestible if delivered another way. 

===============================

My greatest take away from the symposium is to not be discouraged by the rough patches I have/will face in my journey to become my a physician. Listening to neurosurgeons talk about how they have struggled and have 
overcome those difficulties to get to where they are today was incredibly inspirational. In addition, I learned about some very interesting careers like being a surgeon-scientist and Global surgery, which I plan on learning more about to see if they are right for me. I think the committee did a great job planning and organizing this event! It was a great experience where I learned a lot! 

===============================

The different pathways the speakers had undergone to reach neurosurgery. I was intrigued by the speaker that mentioned they had originally been a dancer and switched into medical school. It brought to my attention that the sciences aren't the only pathway into medical school. Something new that I learned or in this case encountered was being able to witness other individuals of minority groups that have become neurosurgeons. Allowing me to see that the career that I want for myself is attainable. It made my goal seem real and not that far off.

===============================

This was so inspiring. As a person of color, it was an honor to see so many success people of color in the field I want to pursue. Especially after meeting only one Haitian physician in my life, connecting with others was amazing. Shadowin an oncologist, and witnessing the adverse effect of cancer spreading to the brain, it‚Äôs motivating to see the advancements being made in research to combat this. It has definitely changed my perspective on Neurosurgery and highly piqued my interest in the field. Amazing amazing. I loved. Super thankful!

===============================

The biggest takeaway for me has been seeing neurosurgeons and other physicians from all walks of life speak to the value of hard work and living as your authentic self. It reaffirmed how important it is to find what gives me joy and to live by it despite the obstacles in one‚Äôs life and career. 

I believe the planning committee did a fantastic job and kept a streamlined symposium. I think that having an outline of the day‚Äôs agenda more readily available could go a long way into seeing what best to focus on as an attendee.

===============================

One of the biggest takeaways I got from the symposium was that with determination and strive, becoming a neurosurgeon is achievable. I loved hearing about the trials and tribulations Dr. Edjah Nduom faced on his neurosurgeon journey. I also loved being able to see all the representations of different races during this symposium. As a black women, hearing Dr. Chambers discuss her story was refreshing. I also didn't realize how the work-life balance neurosurgeons had (with proper time management and prioritization). 

===============================

A big takeaway from this symposium that many kept on mentioning is that we are all different. We all grew up differently and learned differently, and the only person who knows how much you can give is yourself. So it's best to stop comparing myself to others because only I know my strengths and limits. This thought changed the way I viewed everything in my life. I enjoyed this symposium very much! Everyone gave good tips and I've learned so much about phd/md programs, as well as how the life of a Neurosurgeon is.

===============================

I was a bit disappointed that it was an online symposium, but some of the topics about neurosurgery, especially neurosurgery research, were interesting. I don't think this was a good event for me considering I went to multiple conferences and heard about the same things said in this conference. However, I felt like this is still a good conference for some of my friends interested in going into this line of work and would still recommend them to participate and learn a lot from said conference.

===============================

My greatest takeaway from the symposium is that nothing is impossible in the field of neurosurgery and medicine in general. To be successful in the field, one has to always strive to bring out the very best in them. Having great teamwork skills, integrity, and strong will to pursue the path could be some of a future neurosurgeon‚Äôs best attributes that would help us with our journey. 

Overall, the symposium was great. I have attended the inagural symposium and it has gotten better this time.

===============================

The greatest takeaway was everyone's path and journey is different. I have always thought that there was a clear way to medical school and becoming a doctor, but I learned that it is different for every individual and that's okay too. I learned the different types of subspecialties in neurosurgery. It has opened up my mind to the different specialties and it is not just working with your "brain and spine" its more than that, but connecting with the patients and also loving what you are doing. 

===============================

My greatest takeaway was the the actual footage from surgeries that actually took place and I got to have a real life example of what neurosurgery looks like and all the components that come with it. I learned about the process of getting to neurosurgery doesn‚Äôt look the same for everyone, all of the speakers had vastly different experiences but got to the same place. I thought this program was very informative and transformational, it made me fall in love even more with neuroscience <3! 

===============================

One of the most significant takeaways from the symposium is that there is always a resource and opportunity for a student from an underrepresented minority to pursue a career in Neurosurgery. More importantly, it is essential to know what it looks like daily for a career as a neurosurgeon. I also learned that mentorship is critical to support our long journey, especially on the path to becoming a neurosurgeon.

I would love to participate and learn more in the future about career options. 

===============================

The community amongst black and women neurosurgeons is strong and vast in terms of specialities, backgrounds, locations as well as interests. I learned much more knowledge on surgery procedures, imaging and techniques to identify tumors. More importantly, I felt much more connected to my aspiration of neurosurgery and inspired in this pursuit through the empowering stories! Absolutely loved the symposium. Thank you tremendously for organizing, sharing, and the invitation to attend!

===============================

My greatest takeaway is that one should never give up on what they feel called to do with their life despite the adversity/ challenges along the way. One should use their struggles as lessons that ultimately make them wiser and more capable to serve others in the future. At the end of the day we all have to choose who and what we want to become; nobody else can make that decision for us, so we must take responsibility of our life and never let outsiders dictate who we become!

===============================

My biggest takeaway was the growth in my confidence levels that medical school and neurosurgery are in my journey and though it may seem like lots of work, it sounds right for me and thus I feel secure to pursue my passions and goals in this field. I learned about the many opportunities Neurosurgery has, given that I am a woman of color. I was able to learn more about unique neuro-cases and tour a Johns Hopkins Hospital‚Äôs ICU halls and OR. It was an amazing experience!

===============================

The symposium allowed me to understand that there are many non-traditional ways to become a neurosurgeon. I‚Äôve always been worried about the ‚Äúoptional‚Äù requirements that need to be completed in order to be accepted into medical school and then advance into residency. Hearing from actual neurosurgeons during the symposium gave me the opportunity to see that you should just become the best version of yourself and excel in the ways you know how.

===============================

My greatest takeaway from the symposium is that no matter your background, you and your ideas are valuable in the neurosurgery field. I learned about the process of matching to residency and how to become a better applicant for med schools. I loved the symposium, and I am grateful for this opportunity. As a Latina, listening to Dr. Qui√±ones sharing his experience is just a shot of motivation to follow my journey in the medical field. Thank you. 

===============================

I truly enjoyed the diversity between all the speakers and their backgrounds. I think it‚Äôs essential to highlight the differences in upbringing and career pathways so that people from all different walks of life can be inspired to pursue this career. Attending the symposium only furthered my interest in neurosurgery and boosted my confidence in myself that I will be able to get into the field one day despite all the challenges I will face. 

===============================

Going into the neurosurgical field is a bit lengthy, but worth it. I learned that neurological systems include the spine in addition to the brain also that no neuron is the same. I also learned about different programs that can help me on my journey as a black women in this field. Comment for the committee, a planned 30min break would have been nice. 

Loved the symposium, you guys have definitely peaked my interest in the specialty.

===============================

I learned that a career in neurosurgery can look very different whereas before it seemed that there wasn't a lot of variety in the field. I also knew that having a network was important, but today I realized just how far a good network can take you and how vital it is to success in neurosurgery. I think the planning committee did an exceptional job; the symposium succeeded my expectations and I'm so glad I was able to attend.

===============================

The greatest takeaway that I got from this symposium is that there are people who look like me in the field of neurosurgery that I can look up to and that as long as I don't let certain discriminatory aspects of the medical field keep me down, then I can be a neurosurgeon through and through. 
I learned a great deal from this symposium about the lives of neurosurgeons, and I am grateful for being a part of this opportunity.

===============================

I really like the symposium as I get to learn the journeys and stories of different surgeons who showed grits and preserved throughout the most challenging pathway in medicine. I am really inspired by their abilities to work and gain such high achievements for themselves and I take that as a motivation to work harder in the future to be able to help more students who are interested in learning about neurosurgery. 

===============================

My greatest takeaway is to keep eye on the long term while thriving daily by keeping consistency. I learned that tumors with no borders will be present with whitish tissue. Thoroughly enjoyed this presentation and learned a lot. Much appreciate the time you and your team put into making this event possible. I really enjoyed the breakout rooms and opportunity to talk with a neurosurgeon and current MD students. 

===============================

The biggest and greatest takeaway from the symposium was most definitely the outstanding advice given by the phenomenal guests and insight to how advocacy on women within the neuroscience field, particularly the neurosurgery career is vital and being Moroccan-Berber-American female who wears the hijab could not continue to open my eyes regarding this matter even more! I absolutely loved the symposium!

===============================

I learned about the different cases neurosurgeons treat throughout their careers. As a parent, I also felt inspired that, although my path is not traditional and I may face rejection, it will lead me to where I‚Äôm destined to be and what is best for my career. The Research Blitz section was the most impactful, in my opinion‚Äîfrom Dr. Rodriguez‚Äôs cases to Dr. Levi‚Äôs and Dr. Q.‚Äôs prosperity. 

===============================

My greatest takeaway from the symposium was the backstory of what led them to neurosurgery. I loved hearing the Doctors and mentors speak on what influenced them to continue pursuing medicine, specifically neurology. This has made a huge impact to me, as a first generation hispanic woman. I want to thank everyone for sharing their informative stories, resources, advice, and kind words. 

===============================

My greatest takeaway is that my journey is going to be what I make of it, and I can be a well-rounded person regardless of my occupation. I attend Baylor University as an undergraduate, but I didn‚Äôt know that Baylor offered a DOD military slot. I thought that was really interesting! I thought the symposium was really great, you guys should be very proud of yourselves! 

===============================

What is your greatest takeaway from the 
symposium? 
There are a lot of black neurosurgeons.

What is something new that you learned? 
That I can create my own unique path to become a neurosurgeon. 

Do you have any comments that you would like to share with the planning committee?
Please share a recording of the event with those who participated as students and guest. 

===============================

I had no real experience with cases. Only reading about it. So being able to see it with the doctors explaining the case was awesome. Having a clear idea of the routine of a neurosurgeon and being able to ask questions like family dynamics and everything was super helpful to me too. Being a woman, I worry about not having time to my family or to give my kids attention.

===============================

The greatest takeaway from the symposium is that everyone's journey to medicine, specifically, neurosurgery, is different, and constant comparison brings us down. By connecting with others who've been in your position and find a way to preserve, becoming a physician or neurosurgery is not out of your boundaries. It can and will happen. "It is not rocket science!"

===============================

Something new that I learned from the symposium is the nuances of neurosurgery and how important it is to helping people recover. I have always had a passion for neurology and psychology but I never considered neurosurgery until after today‚Äôs symposium. It was very informative and helpful to my learning and development as a future medical school applicant. 

===============================

I found that I've definitely learned more about how to become a neurosurgeon, and the potential paths to that career after undergraduate, as well as a lot about some of the specific specialties on neurosurgery. I found the symposium to be interesting, and accessible even to someone like me, who hadn't had much exposure to neurosurgery prior to the symposium.

===============================

I have learned that there ARE minorities in neurosurgery and they are so kind and willing to help interested students for anything at all. This was an amazing event that it was clear there was so much effort and interest and passion during the planning and presenting processes. I‚Äôm incredibly grateful to have been exposed to so much about neurosurgery. 

===============================

My greatest takeaway was getting to ask questions to the med students during the small breakout sessions and getting their input on what I wanted to know. Something new that I learned was there are many research opportunities that you can get started on even if you are not in medical school yet based on the type of specialty and career path you take on. 

===============================

There are many facets and stages to becoming a neurosurgeon. It is critical to understand the commitment and energy that goes into the profession. I learned a surprising amount about MRI scans and how cases can help you refine your practice. The case studies taking us through many different circumstances was fascinating. Thank for an amazing symposium!

===============================

I felt really inspired by the speakers,, specially Dr. Quinones because he is Mexican and have own must of my goals. Something new I learned was about the residence/PhD programs, it‚Äôs really interesting. Thank you for all the support, it was an amazing event, I would like to suggest to promote this kind of events for future IMG from Latin America. 

===============================

This event was amazing! I learned a lot about the field of neurosurgery and how to overcome obstacles in my journey towards medical school. I learned that everybody‚Äôs path is different and unique. The neurosurgery cases was my favorite part of the symposium. As a black pre-med student, I am extremely grateful for this opportunity. Thank you!

===============================

That if you put your mind to something, whether it‚Äôs be apart of translational research or have a work to life balance in a field like surgery, it can happen with just the right resources and mentorship. This was a great collection of sessions that showed me I‚Äôm capable of pursing neurosurgery, even though I never really though about it!

===============================

I learned about what it means to be a neurosurgeon and how different paths in life can take you there. From the symposium, I know that building connections and having a strong support system can help you get to where you are. I think this was an amazing opportunity and would love to participate more and refer others to this in the future.

===============================

My greatest takeaway is the importance of creating relationships with people and mentors. I learnt a lot about neurosurgery and the life of a neurosurgeon. I would like to thank the planning committee for giving everyone this opportunity. It is hugely beneficial to the way I am planning my undergrad education and my future endeavours.

===============================

The greatest takeaway from the symposium is the hard work that is put into caring for people. during the symposium, I was told that sometimes neurosurgery work 12 hour shifts and this led me to appreciate their work and how hard they work. Neurosurgeons are underappreciated and I wish they got the recognition that they deserve. 

===============================

I just really enjoyed the entire conference. The months of work that went into it really showed in the presentations, and the panel line up. Great, informative job!! Everyone also motivated me even more to continue perusing this path, since I can often get discouraged and feel out of place. It was great being apart of this! 

===============================

Befire this symposium I had no idea about how many years it takes to become a neurosurgeon, and this symposium taught me the pathway to become one. This information was the most helpful information for me as it provides a general guideline that I can use to draw my own pathway to become a neurosurgeon in the future.

===============================

There is a much larger community of young adults, specifically minorities that are pursuing neurosurgery than I thought previously. I learned that the path to neurosurgery probably won‚Äôt be smooth. Great great great planning, topics and speakers! This was an amazing event and I hope to attend it again!

===============================

Thank you for organizing this symposium. I really enjoyed attending, and I learned about the different life paths of neurosurgeons. My greatest takeaway from the symposium is that there is no set path to becoming a neurosurgeon, and that it is very important to build connections along the way.

===============================

I really enjoyed hearing the background and stories behind every doctor or health professional. It was very encouraging for me to be able to relate to these people‚Äôs life experiences and see how far it took them. They also have really great advice which I will definitely take with me. 

===============================

Greatest takeaway is to love and be dedicated to your career. Something new I learnt is research is a solid foundation in a neurosurgical career. I want to say thank you to the planning committee. Can this forum be extended to IMGs and the international Medical Community, worldwide??

===============================

Know your worth. 
My path may look different but so does everyone's so I shouldn't let that dissuade me from pursuing passion.
I liked the break out session, but many of us were a little shy so maybe having everyone introduce themselves and asking for cameras on would help.

===============================

That there are neurosurgeons who have had a long tough road. And there are people willing to mentor and support. Please allow for more time networking!! Such as putting us in groups based off years in school. So just undergrad small group, post bacs, grad students Etc 

===============================

The greatest impact for me was being able to see black and Latinx neurosurgeons and women at that! I learned different subspecialties to neurosurgery. I would like to share that this experience was incredible and I hope there will be future events such as this one 

===============================

What I took away was a newfound confidence in myself and my abilities to become a neurosurgeon as a Hispanic woman. The symposium gave me an idea of what I want to shape my life to be as someone who loves neurosurgery and wants to seriously consider it as a career.

===============================

I learned that you can do anything you put your mind too and your path is no one else‚Äôs path. Also I learned that you can still do research and be a surgeon at the same time. I want to say thank you for this opportunity, it was amazing and I had a great time. 

===============================

Even though I couldn‚Äôt stay for the whole symposium, I enjoyed learning about the neurosurgery field of medicine. I learned about the interesting cases that were presented, which was my first time seeing a doctor explain what was being done to the patient. 

===============================

I absolutely loved the symposium and how organized and well-prepared everything was. I was starting to doubt I truly wanted to pursue neurosurgery, but this conference renewed the spark that was starting to die in me. Kind of like the booster shot I needed. 

===============================

Hearing about the failures and how physicians turned their weaknesses into strengths. That gave me the confidence that was needed. I think that next time, If we could divide and do more small sections more often during the symposium, that would be great. 

===============================

I really enjoyed the symposium and thank all who worked to make it successful! My greatest takeaway is that all doctors experience different paths to become a physician and that we should learn from these experiences. They often make us a better doctor. 

===============================

I think the greatest thing I learned is that despite failures and people saying you can‚Äôt do something you can if you just keep your mind on the prize. To continue to go after your ‚Äúwhy‚Äù and say that you can do it. I think the symposium was great. 

===============================

The true value in finding someone who genuinely cares about you and your success is unmatched especially if they‚Äôre a mentor. Finding a mentor and networking are so important and fundamental to success in undergraduate and graduate school.

===============================

I'm interested in studying some extreme cases and I understand better when a neurosurgeon should taking operative action on a patient. Neurosurgery never ceases to make my jaw drop! Great surgical case presentations from resident all stars.

===============================

Everyone doesn‚Äôt have life figured out. You figure it out one at a time. It is possible to become a neurosurgeon. It would be awesome if the committee could share the faculty speakers contact information so we‚Äôre able to contact them.

===============================

My greatest takeaway from the symposium is the importance of networking. Having people who know and can testify to your abilities goes a long way.
Thank you so much for this opportunity. It was extremely informative and I learnt a lot.

===============================

My biggest takeaway is that it can be done. Sometimes you may face setbacks but it is possible to become a neurosurgeon. I learned different ways to make connections as well as get involved with research and internship opportunities. 

===============================

My biggest takeaway was reiterated time and time again by many of the speakers, to pursue your career goals despite people that tell you that you cannot achieve that goal. It was a very welcoming and pleasant session, thank you!

===============================

I really liked the variety of backgrounds that the neurosurgeons had, and how I could relate to some. 
In the future it‚Äôd be nice if it was in person and we could tour an actual OR and maybe even shadow an ongoing procedure

===============================

My greatest take away was seeing the representation of women of color and seeing a future that is attainable for me. I also felt a strong sense of inspiration and motivation from the event, so it was certainly uplifting. 

===============================

Thanks so much for the opportunity to be exposed to a very fascinating specialty in medicine. Thank you also for organizing an event that provides role models from minority social groups and giving them a platform. 

===============================

I really enjoyed hearing different experiences and different points of views. I enjoyed the women talking about how they have a life with their family and simultaneously have an amazing neurosurgical career. 

===============================

That for someone like me, it is possible to become a neurosurgeon and there is so much growth projected!

How can we remain involved with FLNSUS?
Can we please have access to the emails of the speakers?

===============================

Dr.Simpson is so inspiring and open with her journey and it makes rethink my future decisions and to push through any obstacles. When I get into med school I will stay in no matter the challenges!

===============================

Learned how to be a leader and how to set myself up for success and get back up after a failure. I know a lot more about neurosurgery and the field of neuroscience than I did before. Thank you. 

===============================

Becoming a neurosurgeon in combination with research or other lifestyle choices is definitely possible. It just requires dedication, passion, commitment, and the support of peers and mentors!

===============================

My biggest takeaway from this symposium is the importance of taking advantage of great opportunities and resources that are available when you can. Don't give up and stay focused on your goal

===============================

It was great to see and hear from neurosurgeons who come from diverse backgrounds and they only inspired me further to believe that I can become a neurosurgeon myself by working hard!

===============================

This meeting made me much more motivated, the tips received from the speakers was really great. The breakout rooms was my favorite because we got to interact with other students. 

===============================

Neurosurgeons are regular people and not intimidating at all. There are many things one can do within neurosurgery and that's exciting. Thank you for putting this event together.

===============================

I became revitalized after attending the 2022 symposium. I learned about additional resources and genuinely appreciate everyone‚Äôs time and efforts into making today possible.

My biggest takeaway from the symposium was that everyone‚Äôs path is different and you should stick to your path.

===============================

This was an amazing symposium. I wish I had something like this when I was in undergrad. Keep up the great work!

I am not a technician but a collaborator - Dr. Q
PhD during residency - Dr. Rodriguez
Academics #1 - Dr. Bonsrah

===============================

I learned that people like me can be neurosurgeons and there are so many paths to take towards that end goal.

===============================

I truly enjoyed hearing about the nonlinear paths many of the neurosurgeons had to be where they are today.

===============================

I was excited to learn the different forms of neurosurgery that existed especially the global side of it .
